# Coding Web Application

Web application URL: https://frontendcodingwebapplication-production.up.railway.app/

Both servers also run smoothly on Railway.
All tasks have been completed. As a bonus, an alert with a "good job" message has been added instead of an image.

## Backend

The backend server is located in the `back_end` folder, primarily built using Express.js and Socket.IO. In this Git repository, the server is configured to run locally on `localhost`. You can find the backend server that runs on railway.app on the following GitHub repository: [Backend Coding Web Application](https://github.com/michaelMatve/backend_coding_web_application).

The logic remains the same, but the difference lies in the URLs. I use `localhost` locally, and on the other hand, I use the Railway URLs. The next step was to set them as variables so that I could use the same server.

## Frontend

The frontend server is located in the `front_end` folder, mainly built using React. In this Git repository, the server is configured to run locally on `localhost`. You can find the frontend server that runs on railway.app on the following GitHub repository: [Frontend Coding Web Application](https://github.com/michaelMatve/frontend_coding_web_application).

The logic is consistent, with the only difference being the URLs. I use `localhost` locally and the Railway URLs otherwise. The next step was to set them as variables so that I could use the same server.
